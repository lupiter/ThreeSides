1.1.0
Added support for use as a CommonJS module.  This enables using UCSV as a
library in Mozilla (Jetpack) Add-ons.  It should also allow use in Node.js
environments. Moved the strict mode declaration into the closure and cleaned
up some other formatting to make JSLint happy.

1.0.3
Bug fix in arrayToCsv.  arrayToCsv now wraps lines containing newline
characters with double-quotes as was originally intended. Thanks goes to Colin
Keenan for discovering and reporting this bug. (http://code.google.com/p/rentap/)

1.0.2
csvToArray now returns empty fields as nulls instead of empty strings as
suggested by Leon Bambrick (http://secretGeek.net).
csvToArray now converts non-quoted integers and floats to the appropriate type
instead of assuming they are strings.

Minor spelling fix.

1.0.1
A couple of tweaks to get JSLint passing again.
Removed the global flag from the trim function's RegExps to improve the performance.
